# VisualHand â€” Offline Demo (Prevention-Focused)

This is an **offline dummy website** to demo the VisualHand concept for pitches (e.g., YCPD). No internet required.

## What it shows
- **SOS activation** (button or stealth voice code)
- **Duress code** (marks alert under coercion)
- **Nearby responder alerts** and **Listen Mode** (anonymized alerts for prevention)
- **Caregiver check-ins** (I'm Safe / Skip)
- **Authorized Monitor Dashboard** (toggle "Monitor Mode" to simulate restricted access)
- **Map view** (simulated positions: user, responders, alerts)
- **Alert fatigue controls**: opt-in as responder, listen mode, alert sounds

## Branding
- Black + neon blue, as requested.

## How to run
1. Download the ZIP and extract it.
2. Open `index.html` in **Chrome** or **Edge** (double-click).
3. You can switch to **Monitor Mode** using the toggle in the top-right.
4. Click the ðŸ†˜ button or set a **voice code** and press **Simulate**.
5. Toggle **Duress Code** to show how forced activations are flagged.

> Note: This is a UI/logic simulation only. No data leaves your computer.

## Files
- `index.html` â€” layout and structure
- `styles.css` â€” styling (black + neon)
- `app.js` â€” simple simulation logic
- `assets/logo.svg` â€” placeholder logo
- `assets/beep.mp3` â€” simple beep tone (embedded)

## Talking points for concerns
- **Dashboard privacy**: Only vetted monitors access it (simulated via "Monitor Mode").
- **Forced alerts**: Duress flag lets responders treat it with caution.
- **Alert fatigue**: Opt-in + listen mode keeps alerts targeted and non-spammy.
